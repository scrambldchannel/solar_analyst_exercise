This is some sample sales and cost data (i.e. a P&L) for a fictional company that sells green energy products (remind you of anyone?). It is what management currently uses to monitor financial performance but they are struggling to understand how the business is performing. 

Have a look at the data and think about the following:

What do these numbers tell us about the company?

How could this report be improved? (i.e. what is this report not telling us?)

How would you model this data for analysis?
