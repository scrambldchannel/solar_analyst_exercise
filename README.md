# Solar GmbH needs your help!

Solar GmbH is a fictional company selling green energy solutions. Things _seem_ to be going well, and the company is continuing to expand its product offerings. However, management isn't sure how to interpret the numbers they receive and how they can use them to make strategic decisions. That's why they need you!


# How you can help

The current financial report was created by Trevor, an intern who has since left. You can find it [here](solar_gmbh_management_report.xlsx).

I know it's your first day, but can you have a look at it and do your best to answer the following questions?

+ What do these numbers tell us about the company and the different product offerings?
+ How could this report be improved? (i.e. what is this report not telling us?)
+ How would you better model this data for analysis?

Don't be afraid to ask for **more data** or point out deficiencies in the current report, that's what we're paying you for after all!
